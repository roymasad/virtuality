# virtuality
QBASIC graphic demos collection from the 90s MSDOS program

Code : Roy Massaad

Year : circa 1996

Type : Archive/Nostalgia

Tech : QBASIC MSDOS


Virtually is a collage of a dozen or so small QBASIC animation programs i did as a teen in the mid 1990s
I started coding small demos to recreate things i've seen in screensavers, video games or when testing what custom weird animations i could program using trigonomitry, which after a while i decided to put them all together.


Notes:
-The code is all QBASIC and Quickbasic 4.5 compatible, it compiles to a .exe if you build it

-The demo will run faster if you build it instead of just running it interpreted in Qbasic directly

-All graphic demo scenes are in separate sub routines

-I had trouble fitting them all in the 64k limit of normal qbasic programs

-I didnt use/know any advanced drawing technics, like drawing/poking directly into video memory buffers

-Since i used the builtin QBasic drawing functions, the re-draw is slow

-I used repeated clear screen commands to clear the screen between frames, this leaves a horrible effect that disrupts smooth animation. I didnt know how to get around that back then

-The FPS will fluctuate depending on the machine that is running it, i developed this on a 486 DX2 and later 486 DX4, so that was the reference machine speed for it

-The code is ancient and primitive and inconsistent between modules, but i preferred learning programing some animation effect over doing another 'hello world' program

-Primitive as it may, There is quite a list of animations, heart and personality in this all things considered
